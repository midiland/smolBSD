# smolBSD

This project aims at creating a minimal _NetBSD_ virtual machine that's able to boot and
start a service in less than a second.  
Previous _NetBSD_ installation is not required, using the provided tools the _microvm_ can be
created from any _NetBSD_, _GNU/Linux_, MacOS system and probably more.

When creating the image on a _NetBSD_ system, the image will be formatted using FFS, when
creating the image on a _GNU/Linux_ system, the image will be formatted using _ext2_.

[PVH][4] boot and various optimizations enable _NetBSD/amd64_ and _NetBSD/i386_ to directly boot from a [PVH][4] capable VMM (QEMU or Firecracker) in a couple **milliseconds**.  

As of June 2025, most of these features are integrated in [NetBSD's current kernel][6], and [NetBSD 11 releases][7] those still pending are available in my [NetBSD development branch][5].

You can fetch a pre-built 64 bits kernel at https://smolbsd.org/assets/netbsd-SMOL and a 32 bits kernel at https://smolbsd.org/assets/netbsd-SMOL386  
Warning those are _NetBSD-current_ kernels!

`aarch64` `netbsd-GENERIC64` kernels are able to boot directly to the kernel with no modification

## Project structure

- `mkimg.sh` creates a root filesystem image

       [-k kernel] [-o] [-c URL]
        Create a root image

        -c URL          URL to a script to execute as finalizer
        -o              read-only root filesystem
```
- `startnb.sh` starts a _NetBSD_ virtual machine using `qemu-system-x86_64` or `qemu-system-aarch64`
```text
Usage:  startnb.sh -f conffile | -k kernel -i image [-c CPUs] [-m memory]
        [-a kernel parameters] [-r root disk] [-h drive2] [-p port]
        [-t tcp serial port] [-w path] [-x qemu extra args]
        [-b] [-n] [-s] [-d] [-v]

        Boot a microvm
        -f conffile     vm config file
        -k kernel       kernel to boot on
        -i image        image to use as root filesystem

        -a parameters   append kernel parameters
        -r root disk    root disk to boot on
        -l drive2       second drive to pass to image
        -t serial port  TCP serial port

        -v              verbose
        -h              this help
```
- `sets` contains _NetBSD_ "sets" by architecture, i.e. `amd64/base.tgz`, `evbarm-aarch64/rescue.tgz`...
- `etc` holds common `/etc` files to be installed in the root filesystem
- `service` structure:

```sh
service
├── base
│   ├── etc
│   │   └── rc
│   └── postinst
│       └── dostuff.sh
├── common
│   └── basicrc
└── rescue
    └── etc
        └── rc
```
A microvm is seen as a "service", for each one:

- there **COULD** be a `postinst/anything.sh` which will be executed by `mkimg.sh` at the end of root basic filesystem preparation. **This is executed by the build host at build time**
- if standard _NetBSD_ `init` is used, there **MUST** be an `etc/rc` file, which defines what is started at vm's boot. **This is executed by the microvm**.
- image specifics **COULD**  be added in `make(1)` format in `options.mk`, i.e.
```sh
$ cat service/nbakery/options.mk
# size of resulting inage in megabytes
IMGSIZE=1024
# as of 202510, there's no NetBSD 11 packages for !amd64
.if defined(ARCH) && ${ARCH} != "amd64"
PKGVERS=10.1
.endif
```

In the `service` directory, `common/` contains scripts that will be bundled in the
`/etc/include` directory of the microvm, this would be a perfect place to have something like:

```sh
$ cat common/basicrc
export HOME=/
export PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/pkg/bin:/usr/pkg/sbin
umask 022

mount -a

if ifconfig vioif0 >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        # default qemu addresses and routing
        ifconfig vioif0 10.0.2.15/24
        route add default 10.0.2.2
        echo "nameserver 10.0.2.3" > /etc/resolv.conf
fi

ifconfig lo0 127.0.0.1 up

export TERM=dumb
```

And then add this to your `rc`:
```sh
. /etc/include/basicrc
```

## ⚠️  Warning ⚠️

If you use directly your host to build images, `postinst` operations are run as `root` **in the build host: only use relative paths** in order **not** to impair your host's filesystem.

## Prerequisite

For the microvm to start instantly, you will need a kernel that is capable of "direct booting" with the `qemu -kernel` flag.

**For `amd64`/`PVH` and `i386`/`PVH`**

Download the `SMOL` kernel

```sh
$ bmake kernfetch
```

**For `aarch64`**

Download a regular `netbsd-GENERIC64.img` kernel

```sh
$ bmake ARCH=evbarm-aarch64 kernfetch
```

## Notes on image building

* If you are running NetBSD or GNU/Linux, you can build most images using respectively `make` or `bmake`
* If you are not running NetBSD, a safer, cleaner way of building images is to use the `build` image builder:
  * either by building it if you are running GNU/Linux
```sh
$ bmake buildimg
```
  * or by simply fetching it if you are running other systems such as MacOS
```sh
$ bmake ARCH=evbarm-aarch64 fetchimg
```
Both methods will create an `images/build-<arch>.img` disk image that you'll be able to use to build services.  
To do so, in the following examples commands, replace `base` with `build`, i.e.:
```sh
$ bmake SERVICE=nitro build # instead of bmake SERVICE=nitro base
```
This will spawn a microvm running the build image, and will in turn build the requested service.

## Example of a very minimal (10MB) virtual machine

> Note: you can use the ARCH variable to specify an architecture to build your image for, default is amd64.

```sh
$ bmake rescue
```
Will create a `rescue-amd64.img` file for use with an _amd64_ kernel.
```sh
$ bmake MOUNTRO=y rescue
```
Will also create a `rescue-amd64.img` file but with read-only root filesystem so the _VM_ can be stopped without graceful shutdow
```sh
$ bmake ARCH=i386 rescue
```
Will create a `rescue-i386.img` file for use with an _i386_ kernel.
```sh
$ bmake ARCH=evbarm-aarch64 rescue
```
Will create a `rescue-evbarm-aarch64.img` file for use with an _aarch64_ kernel.

Start the microvm
```sh
$ ./startnb.sh -k netbsd-SMOL -i rescue-amd64.img
```

## Example of an image filled with the `base` set on an `x86_64` CPU

```sh
$ bmake base
$ ./startnb.sh -k netbsd-SMOL -i base-amd64.img
```

## Example of an image running the `bozohttpd` web server on an `aarch64` CPU

Services are build on top of the `base` image, this can be overriden with the `BASE` `make(1)` variable.  
Service name is specified with the `SERVICE` `make(1)` variable.

```sh
$ make ARCH=evbarm-aarch64 SERVICE=bozohttpd base
$ ./startnb.sh -k netbsd-GENERIC64.img -i bozohttpd-evbarm-aarch64.img -p ::8080-:80

## Example of starting a _VM_ with bi-directionnal socket to _host_

```sh
$ bmake SERVICE=mport MOUNTRO=y base
$ ./startnb.sh -n 1 -i mport-amd64.img 
host socket 1: s885f756bp1.sock
```
On the guest, the corresponding socket is `/dev/ttyVI0<port number>`, here `/dev/ttyVI01`
```sh
guest$ echo "hello there!" >/dev/ttyVI01
```
```sh
host$ socat ./s885f756bp1.sock -
hello there!
```
## Example of a full fledge NetBSD Operating System

```sh
$ bmake live # or make ARCH=evbarm-aarch64 live
$ ./startnb.sh -f etc/live.conf
```
This will fetch a directly bootable kernel and a _NetBSD_ "live", ready-to-use, disk image. Login with `root` and no password. To extend the size of the image to 4 more GB, simply do:

```sh
$ dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=4000 >> NetBSD-amd64-live.img
```
And reboot.

## Environment variables

The following environment variables change `mkimg.sh` behavior:

* `ADDPKGS` will **untar** the packages paths listed in the variable, this is done in `postinst` stage, on the build host, where `pkgin` might not be available
* `ADDSETS` will add the sets paths listed in the variable

The following environment variables change `startnb.sh` behavior:

* `QEMU` will use custom `qemu` instead of the one in user's `$PATH`

## Basic frontend

A simple virtual machine manager is available in the `app/` directory, it is a
`python/Flask` application and needs the following requirements:

* `Flask`
* `psutil`

Start it in the `app/` directory like this: `python3 app.py` and a _GUI_ like
the following should be available at `http://localhost:5000`:
